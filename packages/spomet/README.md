Spomet is a full-text search package for Meteor. You should check it's [main repository](https://github.com/Crenshinibon/spomet) for more information and an example application.


Additionally a much nicer example can be found [here](https://github.com/Crenshinibon/ideas)


And [here](http://shiggyenterprises.wordpress.com/2013/09/28/developing-a-full-text-search-enabled-meteor-app/) is a (beginners) tutorial showing in quite some detail how I made this example app.
